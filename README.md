## This is a redux of s0biet's m0d-s0biet-v project. I've ported over the natives.h from ScriptHookV in to a format that NativeInvoke::Invoke uses, and I added an automatic hash updater. It should work, so long as the signatures don't break. But it's much easier to update a few signatures than grab 50+ hashes. ##
